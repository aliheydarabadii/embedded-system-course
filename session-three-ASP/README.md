### Application-Specific Processors (ASP), DSPs, Network Processors, and Microcontrollers

---

# 🧩 Application-Specific Processors (ASP)
ASP are designed when embedded systems require **high specialization** and a **small, fixed set of functions**.  
General Purpose Processors often fail to meet constraints on:
- performance  
- power  
- size  
- determinism  

Therefore, several specialized architectures exist:
- **Digital Signal Processors (DSP)**
- **Network Processors (NP)**
- **Microcontrollers (MCU)**

# 🎧 Digital Signal Processors (DSP)
DSPs are optimized specifically for **numeric computation**, especially repetitive operations on streams of data such as audio, video, and sensor signals.

## ⭐ Key Feature: The MAC Operation
DSP code frequently uses the pattern:
